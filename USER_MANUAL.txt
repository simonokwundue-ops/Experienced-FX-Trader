3. EA OVERVIEW AND FUNCTIONALITY
================================================================================

HOW THE EA WORKS:
------------------

The Quantum Forex Trader EA operates in four main phases:

PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION
- Collects historical price data (default: 256 bars)
- Uses power-of-2 values optimal for quantum-inspired algorithms
- Analyzes closing prices across the specified timeframe

PHASE 2: BINARY ENCODING
- Converts price movements into binary sequence (1 = up, 0 = down)
- Creates quantum-compatible representation of market behavior
- Identifies patterns in binary sequences

PHASE 3: QUANTUM ANALYSIS
- Generates probability distribution of market states
- Simulates quantum phase estimation
- Calculates confidence levels for each potential outcome
- Identifies dominant trend (BULL/BEAR/NEUTRAL)

PHASE 4: SIGNAL GENERATION & EXECUTION
- Generates trading signals based on:
  * Trend direction (BULL or BEAR)
  * Confidence level (probability of outcome)
  * Momentum strength
- Executes trades when all conditions are met
- Manages risk automatically

WHAT THE EA DOES:
-----------------
✓ Analyzes market continuously
✓ Generates BUY/SELL signals based on quantum analysis
✓ Opens positions automatically
✓ Sets stop loss and take profit levels
✓ Manages position sizing based on account risk
✓ Respects maximum drawdown limits
✓ Logs all activities to Experts log

WHAT THE EA DOES NOT DO:
-------------------------
✗ Does not use traditional indicators (MA, RSI, MACD)
✗ Does not require manual intervention
✗ Does not guarantee profits (no EA can)
✗ Does not work without proper risk management

================================================================================
6. TRADING STRATEGY
================================================================================

STRATEGY OVERVIEW:
------------------

The EA uses a quantum-inspired approach to market analysis:

1. BINARY ENCODING
   - Converts 256 bars of price data into binary sequence
   - "1" = price went up
   - "0" = price went down
   - Creates pattern signature of market behavior

2. QUANTUM STATE ANALYSIS
   - Generates multiple "quantum states" (possible market outcomes)
   - Each state has associated probability
   - Identifies dominant states (most probable outcomes)

3. TREND IDENTIFICATION
   - Analyzes top probability states
   - Calculates bullish vs bearish probability
   - Determines trend direction:
     * BULL: Bullish probability > Bearish probability
     * BEAR: Bearish probability > Bullish probability
     * NEUTRAL: Probabilities roughly equal

4. MOMENTUM CALCULATION
   - Measures strength of trend
   - Higher momentum = stronger trend
   - Used as confirmation filter

5. SIGNAL GENERATION
   - BUY Signal requires:
     * Trend = BULL
     * Confidence >= threshold
     * Momentum >= threshold
   
   - SELL Signal requires:
     * Trend = BEAR
     * Confidence >= threshold
     * Momentum >= threshold

6. TRADE EXECUTION
   - Position size calculated based on risk settings
   - Stop loss and take profit set automatically
   - Trade opened only if risk checks pass

BEST PRACTICES:
---------------

✓ Start with conservative settings on demo account
✓ Test for at least 1-2 weeks before going live
✓ Use on major pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY)
✓ Best timeframes: H1, H4 (enough data, not too noisy)
✓ Monitor during first week of live trading
✓ Keep risk per trade at 1% or lower
✓ Respect maximum drawdown limits
✓ Don't overtrade - let the EA work

DON'T:
------
✗ Don't use on exotic pairs (spread too wide)
✗ Don't use on M1 or M5 (too much noise)
✗ Don't risk more than 2% per trade
✗ Don't disable risk management features
✗ Don't run multiple instances on same symbol
✗ Don't interfere with EA's trades manually

================================================================================
7. RISK MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

The EA includes comprehensive risk management:

POSITION SIZING:
----------------
- Automatically calculated based on:
  * Account balance
  * Risk percentage setting
  * Stop loss distance
  * Signal confidence level

Formula: Lot Size = (Balance × Risk%) / (SL pips × Pip Value)

Example:
- Balance: $10,000
- Risk: 1% = $100
- Stop Loss: 50 pips
- Pip Value: $10/lot for standard lot
- Lot Size = $100 / (50 × $10) = 0.20 lots

DRAWDOWN PROTECTION:
--------------------
- Monitors account drawdown continuously
- Stops trading if drawdown exceeds limit
- Drawdown = (Balance - Equity) / Balance × 100

Example:
- Balance: $10,000
- Equity: $8,500
- Drawdown: (10000 - 8500) / 10000 × 100 = 15%
- If max drawdown set to 20%, EA continues
- If max drawdown set to 10%, EA stops trading

POSITION LIMITS:
----------------
- Maximum concurrent positions enforced
- Prevents overexposure
- One position per symbol maximum (by default)

SPREAD FILTER:
--------------
- Checks spread before opening trades
- Won't trade if spread > 30 pips
- Protects from poor execution during news

RECOMMENDED RISK SETTINGS:
--------------------------

Account Size: $1,000 - $5,000
- Risk Per Trade: 0.5-1.0%
- Max Drawdown: 15%
- Max Positions: 1-2

Account Size: $5,000 - $20,000
- Risk Per Trade: 1.0-1.5%
- Max Drawdown: 20%
- Max Positions: 2-3

Account Size: $20,000+
- Risk Per Trade: 1.0-2.0%
- Max Drawdown: 20-25%
- Max Positions: 3-5
