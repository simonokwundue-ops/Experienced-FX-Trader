6. QUANTUM FEATURES
===========================================

Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE):
- Simulates 22-qubit quantum circuit
- Analyzes 256 candles of price history
- Generates probability distribution for 10 future candles
- Based on IBM Quantum research

Binary Price Encoding:
- Converts price movements to binary sequence
- 1 = price increased, 0 = price decreased
- Creates quantum-ready state representation
- Enables pattern analysis

Quantum Market State Analysis:
- Calculates probability matrix
- Measures quantum entropy (uncertainty)
- Determines trend confidence
- Identifies dominant market state

Quantum Risk Management:
- Adjusts position size based on quantum confidence
- Adapts SL/TP based on quantum entropy
- Evaluates trade quality (0-100 score)
- Calculates optimal trailing stop distance

Quantum Signal Generation:
- Combines classical indicators with quantum probabilities
- Weighted signal scoring (60% quantum + 40% classical)
- Confidence threshold filtering
- Direction confirmation across timeframes

===========================================
7. TRADING STRATEGIES
===========================================

The EA uses 4 classical strategies enhanced with quantum analysis:

1. Moving Average Crossover
   - Fast MA (10) crosses Slow MA (50)
   - Quantum confirms trend direction
   - Slope and distance filters
   
2. RSI Reversal
   - Oversold/Overbought bounce
   - Quantum predicts reversal probability
   - RSI periods: 14 (Base), 9 (Scalper)
   
3. Bollinger Bands
   - Bounce from bands
   - Quantum analyzes mean reversion probability
   - Dynamic bands based on volatility
   
4. MACD
   - Signal line crossover
   - Quantum confirms momentum
   - Divergence detection

Quantum Enhancement:
- Each strategy generates classical score (0-30 points)
- Quantum analysis adds confidence layer
- Combined score determines entry
- Minimum score threshold filters weak signals

===========================================
8. RISK MANAGEMENT
===========================================

Multi-Layer Risk Protection:

1. Position Sizing
   - Quantum-adjusted lot size based on confidence
   - Maximum risk per trade: configurable
   - Portfolio risk limit: 10% default
   
2. Stop Loss / Take Profit
   - ATR-based dynamic sizing
   - Quantum entropy adjustment
   - Minimum protection levels
   
3. Position Management
   - Breakeven move at profit threshold
   - Partial take profit (50% default)
   - Quantum-enhanced trailing stop
   
4. Portfolio Controls
   - Maximum concurrent positions
   - Daily trade limits
   - Session filters
   - Cooldown between trades
   
5. Emergency Protection
   - Max drawdown limit (auto-halt)
   - Spread filter
   - Volatility range filter
   - Market state validation

Quantum Risk Features:
- Risk scales with confidence (high confidence = larger position)
- Entropy-based stop adjustment (high uncertainty = wider stops)
- Trade quality scoring prevents low-probability entries
- Dynamic trailing based on quantum trend strength

===========================================
9. BEST PRACTICES
===========================================

For Best Results:

1. Backtesting
   - Test on 6-12 months historical data
   - Use "Every tick" mode
   - Optimize on training data
   - Validate on out-of-sample data
   
2. Forward Testing
   - Run on demo account 2-4 weeks minimum
   - Monitor quantum win rate
   - Track confidence levels
   - Adjust parameters based on performance
   
3. Live Trading Start
   - Begin with minimum lot size
   - Use conservative settings
   - Monitor first 20-30 trades
   - Gradually increase risk if profitable
   
4. Parameter Optimization
   - QuantumConfidenceThreshold: Key parameter
   - Start high (65-70%) for quality
   - Lower (55-60%) for more trades
   - Monitor win rate vs threshold
   
5. Timeframe Selection
   - Base EA: M15-H1 recommended
   - Scalper: M1-M5 only
   - Higher timeframes = fewer but better trades
   - Lower timeframes = more trades, needs tight spread
   
6. Pair Selection
   - Major pairs recommended (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY)
   - Low spread essential (especially scalping)
   - High liquidity preferred
   - Avoid exotic pairs initially
   
7. Session Trading
   - London session: Best for trends
   - NY session: High volatility
   - Asian session: Range-bound (avoid for trending strategies)
   - Overlap periods: Highest activity

   - Entropy correlation with outcomes
   
2. Trading Performance
   - Overall win rate
   - Profit factor (target: >1.5)
   - Maximum drawdown
   - Average trade duration
   - Risk/reward ratio
   
3. Strategy Performance
   - Individual strategy win rates
   - MA, RSI, BB, MACD effectiveness
   - Multi-timeframe confirmation rate
   - Signal score distribution

How to Monitor:
- Check EA logs in MT5 Experts tab

- Use MT5 Strategy Tester for backtests
- Export trade history to Excel for analysis

Quantum-Specific Monitoring:
- Log shows quantum signal generation
- Confidence levels printed for each signal
- Quantum state description displayed
- Trend strength indicators logged
- Entropy levels recorded

Performance Optimization:
- If win rate < 55%: Increase confidence threshold
